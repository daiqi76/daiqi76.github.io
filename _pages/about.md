Hi, this is Daiqi, a cross-disciplinary learner who transitioned from mechanical engineering to medical engineering. 

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD at the [Pattern Recognition Lab](https://lme.tf.fau.de/) under [Prof. Andreas Maier](https://lme.tf.fau.de/person/maier/) and [Dr. Paula Andrea Pérez-Toro](https://lme.tf.fau.de/person/perez). I’m broadly interested in medical image processing, and particularly passionate about the tight integration of AI and healthcare. I am driven by the belief that this synergy will lead to significant advancements in patient care and medical technology.

My current research topic is everything about **Multimodal Learning in speech MRI**, in collaboration with [Prof. Jana Hutter](https://www.mr-physik.med.fau.de/en/team/prof-dr-jana-hutter/) from [Smart Imaging lab](https://www.mr-physik.med.fau.de/lab/smri-lab-hutter/). If you are also interested in this, please feel free to contact me and our team.
